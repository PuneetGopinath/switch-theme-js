## FAQs
These are the frequently asked questions:

### 1. What happens actually
This is a basic JS code, that stores the theme name in a cookie that stays for 10 days and adds the theme name to the `data-theme` attribute of the html tag.

### 2. How to design a theme?
You need to know CSS for that.

1. Think of a cool theme name
2. To select the theme in CSS, use `[data-theme="themeName"]` where `themeName` is your theme name
3. To add a button for user to switch the theme (use the html `a` tag e.g. `<a href="javascript:switchTheme.switch('dark');">Dark theme</a>`)
4. Add `onload="switchTheme.get();"` to your `body` tag
5. Add `<script async defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/PuneetGopinath/switch-theme-js@v1-dev/src/index.min.js"></script>` in the head tag.
6. Set a default theme by adding `data-theme` attribute to `html` tag, with your default theme name as value
7. That's all, test it out in your website, or submit a bug report for us to Analyse the bug.
